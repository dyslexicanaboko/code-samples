# Code samples
Code samples of any language for the purposes of teaching those who are interested in learning how to program. These code samples will more than likely be linked to a post on my [Obscure Problems and Gotchas](https://obscureproblemsandgotchas.com/) blog.

## Long term goal
Pull together enough examples of the basics across different languages so that any question you could ask about a language will be answered already. The basics never change, when you learn one language they are all about the same. I am a big fan of learn by doing.
